    "* We also want to get analysis data that the Spotify provides for each song.\n",
    "* More information about the data available can be found at [Get Track's Audio Analysis](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#/operations/get-audio-analysis).\n",
    "* In this analysis we will focus on the <code>segments</code> (from the documentation \"*Each segment contains a roughly conisistent sound throughout its duration.*\").\n",
    "* The idea here is that we want to capture information about the rhythm and the listening of the song.\n",
    "* For each track we will obtain two batches of segments, with the size of 200. The first one will be taken from the beginning and the second one from a more middlish part of the song.\n",
    "* Now for each segment we will take:\n",
    "  * **pitches**: \"*a “chroma” vector, corresponding to the 12 pitch classes C, C#, D to B, with values ranging from 0 to 1 that describe the relative dominance of every pitch in the chromatic scale*\"\n",
    "  * **timbre**: \"*Timbre is the quality of a musical note or sound that distinguishes different types of musical instruments, or voices ... The timbre feature is a vector that includes 12 unbounded values roughly centered around 0.*\"\n",
    "  * **loudness_max, loudness_start, loudness_max_duration**: \"*... these components can be used to describe the \"attack\" of the segment.*\"\n",
    "  * **duration**: \"*The duration (in seconds) of the segment.*\"\n",
    "  \n",
    "*From Spotify's Documentation*\n",
    "* The loading of the analyses is time consuming and was parallelized on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). Below is presented the code used.\n"
